# Voting Application

What and How it works

models ?
routes ?

voting functionality

1.  create a new user 
2. user signin / sign up
3. vote at once only to only one candidate (user can't vote again)
4. there is router which shows the list of candidates and their live votes (count)
    (Sorted by their vote count)
5. user data contains their one unique government ID proof name : aadhar card
6. there should be only one admin who can maintain the table of candidates and
    (he can't able to vote at all)
7. user can only login with aadhar card number and password.
8. Admin can't vote at  all.
9. user can change the password
